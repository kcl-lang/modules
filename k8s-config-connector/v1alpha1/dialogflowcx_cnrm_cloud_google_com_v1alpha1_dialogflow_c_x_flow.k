        They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
        They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
        Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

        They are responsible for matching the user's first utterances in the flow.
