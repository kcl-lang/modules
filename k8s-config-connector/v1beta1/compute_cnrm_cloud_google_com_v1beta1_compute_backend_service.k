        load balancing cannot be used with the other. For more information, refer to

        A list of locality load balancing policies to be used in order of

        Overrides any value set in the localityLbPolicy field.

        localityLbPolicies is only supported when the BackendService is referenced
        by a URL Map that is referenced by a target gRPC proxy that has the
        validateForProxyless field set to true.
    localityLbPolicy : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
        The possible values are:

        * 'ROUND_ROBIN': This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                         is selected in round robin order.

        * 'LEAST_REQUEST': An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                           hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

        * 'RING_HASH': The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                       hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                       addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                       1/N of the requests.

        * 'RANDOM': The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

        * 'ORIGINAL_DESTINATION': Backend host is selected based on the client
                                  connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                  to the same address as the destination address of
                                  the incoming connection before the connection
                                  was redirected to the load balancer.

        * 'MAGLEV': used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                    Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                    build times and host selection times. For more information about
                    Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824

        * 'WEIGHTED_MAGLEV': Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
                             reported weights. If set, the Backend Service must
                             configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
                             health check replies are expected to contain
                             non-standard HTTP response header field
                             X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
                             per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
                             based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
                             processed health check replies, as long as every
                             instance either reported a valid weight or had
                             UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
                             equal-weight.


        This field is applicable to either:

        * A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2,
          and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.
        * A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        * A regional backend service with loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL (External Network
          Load Balancing). Only MAGLEV and WEIGHTED_MAGLEV values are possible for External
          Network Load Balancing. The default is MAGLEV.


        If session_affinity is not NONE, and this field is not set to MAGLEV, WEIGHTED_MAGLEV,
        or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.

        Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced
        by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validate_for_proxyless
        field set to true. Possible values: ["ROUND_ROBIN", "LEAST_REQUEST", "RING_HASH", "RANDOM", "ORIGINAL_DESTINATION", "MAGLEV", "WEIGHTED_MAGLEV"].

        types and may result in errors if used with the GA API. **NOTE**: With protocol “UNSPECIFIED”,
        the backend service can be used by Layer 4 Internal Load Balancing or Network Load Balancing
        with TCP/UDP/L3_DEFAULT Forwarding Rule protocol. Possible values: ["HTTP", "HTTPS", "HTTP2", "TCP", "SSL", "GRPC", "UNSPECIFIED"].

    enforcingConsecutiveErrors : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
        status is detected through consecutive 5xx. This setting can be used to disable
        ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
    enforcingConsecutiveGatewayFailure : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
        status is detected through consecutive gateway failures. This setting can be
        used to disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 0.
    enforcingSuccessRate : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
        status is detected through success rate statistics. This setting can be used to
        disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
    interval : ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeBackendServiceSpecOutlierDetectionInterval, default is Undefined, optional
        interval
    maxEjectionPercent : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Maximum percentage of hosts in the load balancing pool for the backend service
        that can be ejected. Defaults to 10%.
    successRateMinimumHosts : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The number of hosts in a cluster that must have enough request volume to detect
        success rate outliers. If the number of hosts is less than this setting, outlier
        detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any host in the
        cluster. Defaults to 5.
    successRateRequestVolume : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one interval (as
        defined by the interval duration above) to include this host in success rate
        based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
        detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
        to 100.
    successRateStdevFactor : int, default is Undefined, optional
        This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
        ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
        rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
        success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
        by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
        runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.
