    A rule for a deny policy.

    denialCondition : IamCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1IAMDenyPolicySpecRulesItems0DenyRuleDenialCondition, default is Undefined, optional
        denial condition
    deniedPermissions : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The permissions that are explicitly denied by this rule. Each permission uses the format `{service_fqdn}/{resource}.{verb}`, where `{service_fqdn}` is the fully qualified domain name for the service. For example, `iam.googleapis.com/roles.list`.
    deniedPrincipals : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The identities that are prevented from using one or more permissions on
         Google Cloud resources. This field can contain the following values:

         * `principalSet://goog/public:all`: A special identifier that represents
           any principal that is on the internet, even if they do not have a Google
           Account or are not logged in.

         * `principal://goog/subject/{email_id}`: A specific Google Account.
           Includes Gmail, Cloud Identity, and Google Workspace user accounts. For
           example, `principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com`.

         * `deleted:principal://goog/subject/{email_id}?uid={uid}`: A specific
           Google Account that was deleted recently. For example,
           `deleted:principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com?uid=1234567890`. If
           the Google Account is recovered, this identifier reverts to the standard
           identifier for a Google Account.

         * `principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}`: A Google group. For example,
           `principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com`.

         * `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}?uid={uid}`: A Google group
           that was deleted recently. For example,
           `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com?uid=1234567890`. If
           the Google group is restored, this identifier reverts to the standard
           identifier for a Google group.

         * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}`:
           A Google Cloud service account. For example,
           `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

         * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}?uid={uid}`:
           A Google Cloud service account that was deleted recently. For example,
           `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@iam.gserviceaccount.com?uid=1234567890`.
           If the service account is undeleted, this identifier reverts to the
           standard identifier for a service account.

         * `principalSet://goog/cloudIdentityCustomerId/{customer_id}`: All of the
           principals associated with the specified Google Workspace or Cloud
           Identity customer ID. For example,
           `principalSet://goog/cloudIdentityCustomerId/C01Abc35`.
    exceptionPermissions : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies the permissions that this rule excludes from the set of denied
         permissions given by `denied_permissions`. If a permission appears in
         `denied_permissions` _and_ in `exception_permissions` then it will _not_ be
         denied.

         The excluded permissions can be specified using the same syntax as
         `denied_permissions`.
    exceptionPrincipals : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The identities that are excluded from the deny rule, even if they are
         listed in the `denied_principals`. For example, you could add a Google
         group to the `denied_principals`, then exclude specific users who belong to
         that group.

         This field can contain the same values as the `denied_principals` field,
         excluding `principalSet://goog/public:all`, which represents all users on
         the internet.
