        infrastructure ref
    minReadySeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional

        Defaults to 0 (Machine will be considered available as soon as the Machine is ready)
    providerID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        providerID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
        This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
        This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
        with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
        machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
        generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
        able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
        and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
        This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
        be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.
    readinessGates : [ClusterxK8sIoV1beta2MachineSpecReadinessGatesItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        readinessGates specifies additional conditions to include when evaluating Machine Ready condition.

        This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
        Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
        for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

        Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
        they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

        NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
        readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
        readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
        This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).
    taints : [ClusterxK8sIoV1beta2MachineSpecTaintsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        taints are the node taints that Cluster API will manage.
        This list is not necessarily complete: other Kubernetes components may add or remove other taints from nodes,
        e.g. the node controller might add the node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint.
        Only those taints defined in this list will be added or removed by core Cluster API controllers.

        There can be at most 64 taints.
        A pod would have to tolerate all existing taints to run on the corresponding node.

        NOTE: This list is implemented as a "map" type, meaning that individual elements can be managed by different owners.
    version : str, default is Undefined, optional
        version defines the desired Kubernetes version.
        This field is meant to be optionally used by bootstrap providers.

    Condition defines an observation of a Cluster API resource operational state.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
        the API field changed is acceptable.
    message : str, default is Undefined, optional
        message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
        This field may be empty.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, optional
        reason is the reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase.
        The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API.
        This field may be empty.
    severity : str, default is Undefined, optional
        severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
        understand the current situation and act accordingly.
        The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.
    status : str, default is Undefined, required
        status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.
    $type : str, default is Undefined, required
        type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
