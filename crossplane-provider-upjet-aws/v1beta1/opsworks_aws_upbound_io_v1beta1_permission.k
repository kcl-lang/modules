    r"""
    WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
    Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
    be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
    and password required to connect to the managed resource.

    PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
    and connection details would be published to both without affecting
    each other.
