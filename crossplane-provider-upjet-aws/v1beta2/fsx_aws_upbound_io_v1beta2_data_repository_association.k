    dataRepositoryPath : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The path to the Amazon S3 data repository that will be linked to the file system. The path must be an S3 bucket s3://myBucket/myPrefix/. This path specifies where in the S3 data repository files will be imported from or exported to. The same S3 bucket cannot be linked more than once to the same file system.

        Set to true to delete files from the file system upon deleting this data repository association. Defaults to false.

For example, if a data repository is associated with file system path /ns1/, then you cannot link another data repository with file system path /ns1/ns2. This path specifies where in your file system files will be exported from or imported to. This file system directory can be linked to only one Amazon S3 bucket, and no other S3 bucket can be linked to the directory.
