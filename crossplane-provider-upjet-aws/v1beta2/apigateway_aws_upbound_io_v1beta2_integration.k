        tls config
    $type : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Integration input's type. Valid values are HTTP (for HTTP backends), MOCK (not calling any real backend), AWS (for AWS services), AWS_PROXY (for Lambda proxy integration) and HTTP_PROXY (for HTTP proxy integration). An HTTP or HTTP_PROXY integration with a connection_type of VPC_LINK is referred to as a private integration and uses a VpcLink to connect API Gateway to a network load balancer of a VPC.
    uri : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Input's URI. Required if type is AWS, AWS_PROXY, HTTP or HTTP_PROXY.
        For HTTP integrations, the URI must be a fully formed, encoded HTTP(S) URL according to the RFC-3986 specification . For AWS integrations, the URI should be of the form arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:{path|action}/{service_api}. region, subdomain and service are used to determine the right endpoint.
        e.g., arn:aws:apigateway:eu-west-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:123456789012:function:my-func/invocations.

    timeoutMilliseconds : float, default is Undefined, optional
        Custom timeout between 50 and 300,000 milliseconds. The default value is 29,000 milliseconds. You need to raise a Service Quota Ticket to increase time beyond 29,000 milliseconds.
    tlsConfig : ApigatewayAwsUpboundIoV1beta2IntegrationSpecInitProviderTLSConfig, default is Undefined, optional
        tls config
    $type : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Integration input's type. Valid values are HTTP (for HTTP backends), MOCK (not calling any real backend), AWS (for AWS services), AWS_PROXY (for Lambda proxy integration) and HTTP_PROXY (for HTTP proxy integration). An HTTP or HTTP_PROXY integration with a connection_type of VPC_LINK is referred to as a private integration and uses a VpcLink to connect API Gateway to a network load balancer of a VPC.
    uri : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Input's URI. Required if type is AWS, AWS_PROXY, HTTP or HTTP_PROXY.
        For HTTP integrations, the URI must be a fully formed, encoded HTTP(S) URL according to the RFC-3986 specification . For AWS integrations, the URI should be of the form arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:{path|action}/{service_api}. region, subdomain and service are used to determine the right endpoint.
        e.g., arn:aws:apigateway:eu-west-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:123456789012:function:my-func/invocations.

        ID of the VpcLink used for the integration. Required if connection_type is VPC_LINK
    connectionType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Integration input's connectionType. Valid values are INTERNET (default for connections through the public routable internet), and VPC_LINK (for private connections between API Gateway and a network load balancer in a VPC).
    contentHandling : str, default is Undefined, optional
        How to handle request payload content type conversions. Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT. If this property is not defined, the request payload will be passed through from the method request to integration request without modification, provided that the passthroughBehaviors is configured to support payload pass-through.
    credentials : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Credentials required for the integration. For AWS integrations, 2 options are available. To specify an IAM Role for Amazon API Gateway to assume, use the role's ARN. To require that the caller's identity be passed through from the request, specify the string arn:aws:iam::\*:user/\*.

    requestTemplates : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Map of the integration's request templates.
    resourceId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        API resource ID.
    restApiId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        ID of the associated REST API.
    timeoutMilliseconds : float, default is Undefined, optional
        Custom timeout between 50 and 300,000 milliseconds. The default value is 29,000 milliseconds. You need to raise a Service Quota Ticket to increase time beyond 29,000 milliseconds.

        Integration input's type. Valid values are HTTP (for HTTP backends), MOCK (not calling any real backend), AWS (for AWS services), AWS_PROXY (for Lambda proxy integration) and HTTP_PROXY (for HTTP proxy integration). An HTTP or HTTP_PROXY integration with a connection_type of VPC_LINK is referred to as a private integration and uses a VpcLink to connect API Gateway to a network load balancer of a VPC.
    uri : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Input's URI. Required if type is AWS, AWS_PROXY, HTTP or HTTP_PROXY.
        For HTTP integrations, the URI must be a fully formed, encoded HTTP(S) URL according to the RFC-3986 specification . For AWS integrations, the URI should be of the form arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:{path|action}/{service_api}. region, subdomain and service are used to determine the right endpoint.
        e.g., arn:aws:apigateway:eu-west-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:123456789012:function:my-func/invocations. For private integrations, the URI parameter is not used for routing requests to your endpoint, but is used for setting the Host header and for certificate validation.
