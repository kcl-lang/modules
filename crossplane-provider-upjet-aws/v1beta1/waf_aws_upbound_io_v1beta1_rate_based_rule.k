    waf aws upbound io v1beta1 rate based rule status at provider predicates items0

    Attributes
    ----------
    dataId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A unique identifier for a predicate in the rule, such as Byte Match Set ID or IPSet ID.
    negated : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Set this to false if you want to allow, block, or count requests
        based on the settings in the specified ByteMatchSet, IPSet, SqlInjectionMatchSet, XssMatchSet, or SizeConstraintSet.
        For example, if an IPSet includes the IP address 192.0.2.44, AWS WAF will allow or block requests based on that IP address.
        If set to true, AWS WAF will allow, block, or count requests based on all IP addresses except 192.0.2.44.
    $type : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The type of predicate in a rule. Valid values: ByteMatch, GeoMatch, IPMatch, RegexMatch, SizeConstraint, SqlInjectionMatch, or XssMatch.

    r"""
    A Condition that may apply to a resource.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        LastTransitionTime is the last time this condition transitioned from one
        status to another.
    message : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A Message containing details about this condition's last transition from
        one status to another, if any.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        ObservedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
        with respect to the current state of the instance.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, required
        A Reason for this condition's last transition from one status to another.
    status : str, default is Undefined, required
        Status of this condition; is it currently True, False, or Unknown?
    $type : str, default is Undefined, required
        Type of this condition. At most one of each condition type may apply to
        a resource at any point in time.
