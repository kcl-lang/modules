        a no-op if it cannot be resolved.

        Resolve specifies when this reference should be resolved. The default
        is 'IfNotPresent', which will attempt to resolve the reference only when
        the corresponding field is not present. Use 'Always' to resolve the
        reference on every reconcile.
