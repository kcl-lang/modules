    """
    DeploymentSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    minReadySeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)
    paused : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Indicates that the deployment is paused and will not be processed by the deployment controller.
    progressDeadlineSeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to process failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded reason will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will not be estimated during the time a deployment is paused. This is set to the max value of int32 (i.e. 2147483647) by default, which means "no deadline".
    replicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Number of desired pods. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.
    revisionHistoryLimit : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. This is set to the max value of int32 (i.e. 2147483647) by default, which means "retaining all old RelicaSets".
    rollbackTo : RollbackConfig, default is Undefined, optional
        DEPRECATED. The config this deployment is rolling back to. Will be cleared after rollback is done.
    selector : v1.LabelSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by this will be the ones affected by this deployment.
    strategy : DeploymentStrategy, default is Undefined, optional
        The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones.
    template : corev1.PodTemplateSpec, default is Undefined, required
        Template describes the pods that will be created.
