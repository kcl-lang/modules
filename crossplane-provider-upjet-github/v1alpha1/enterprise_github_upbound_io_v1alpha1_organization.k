    InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception

    The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
    avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
    required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
    for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
    autoscaler.
