    providerID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        providerID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
        This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
        This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
        with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
        machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
        generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
        able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
        and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
        This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
        be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.
    readinessGates : [ClusterxK8sIoV1beta2MachineDeploymentSpecTemplateSpecReadinessGatesItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        readinessGates specifies additional conditions to include when evaluating Machine Ready condition.

        This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
        Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
        for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

        Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
        they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

        NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
        readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
        readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
        This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).

        taints are the node taints that Cluster API will manage.
        This list is not necessarily complete: other Kubernetes components may add or remove other taints from nodes,
        e.g. the node controller might add the node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint.
        Only those taints defined in this list will be added or removed by core Cluster API controllers.

        There can be at most 64 taints.
        A pod would have to tolerate all existing taints to run on the corresponding node.

        NOTE: This list is implemented as a "map" type, meaning that individual elements can be managed by different owners.
