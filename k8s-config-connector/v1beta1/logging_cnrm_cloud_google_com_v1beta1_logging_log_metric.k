        Required. An [advanced logs filter](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters) which is used to match log entries. Example: "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR" The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.

        Optional. A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the `value_extractor` field. The extracted value is converted to the type defined in the label descriptor. If the either the extraction or the type conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and for a boolean label its `false`.

        Optional. A `value_extractor` is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction: `EXTRACT(field)` or `REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex)`. The argument are: 1. field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be extracted. 2. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group. The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in the distribution. Example: `REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, ".*quantity=(d+).*")`

schema LoggingCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1LoggingLogMetricSpecMetricDescriptor:
    """
    Optional. The metric descriptor associated with the logs-based metric. If unspecified, it uses a default metric descriptor with a DELTA metric kind, INT64 value type, with no labels and a unit of "1". Such a metric counts the number of log entries matching the `filter` expression. The `name`, `type`, and `description` fields in the `metric_descriptor` are output only, and is constructed using the `name` and `description` field in the LogMetric. To create a logs-based metric that records a distribution of log values, a DELTA metric kind with a DISTRIBUTION value type must be used along with a `value_extractor` expression in the LogMetric. Each label in the metric descriptor must have a matching label name as the key and an extractor expression as the value in the `label_extractors` map. The `metric_kind` and `value_type` fields in the `metric_descriptor` cannot be updated once initially configured. New labels can be added in the `metric_descriptor`, but existing labels cannot be modified except for their description.

    Attributes
    ----------
    displayName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example "Request count". This field is optional but it is recommended to be set for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota.
    labels : [LoggingCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1LoggingLogMetricSpecMetricDescriptorLabelsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        The set of labels that can be used to describe a specific instance of this metric type. For example, the `appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies` metric type has a label for the HTTP response code, `response_code`, so you can look at latencies for successful responses or just for responses that failed.

        metadata
    metricKind : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc. Some combinations of `metric_kind` and `value_type` might not be supported. Possible values: GAUGE, DELTA, CUMULATIVE
    unit : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`. The `unit` defines the representation of the stored metric values. Different systems might scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of `0.02kBy` _might_ be displayed as `20By`, and a value of `3523kBy` _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`). However, if the `unit` is `kBy`, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed. If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`. Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`). The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units of Measure](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard: **Basic units (UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * `s` second * `min` minute * `h` hour * `d` day * `1` dimensionless **Prefixes (PREFIX)** * `k` kilo (10^3) * `M` mega (10^6) * `G` giga (10^9) * `T` tera (10^12) * `P` peta (10^15) * `E` exa (10^18) * `Z` zetta (10^21) * `Y` yotta (10^24) * `m` milli (10^-3) * `u` micro (10^-6) * `n` nano (10^-9) * `p` pico (10^-12) * `f` femto (10^-15) * `a` atto (10^-18) * `z` zepto (10^-21) * `y` yocto (10^-24) * `Ki` kibi (2^10) * `Mi` mebi (2^20) * `Gi` gibi (2^30) * `Ti` tebi (2^40) * `Pi` pebi (2^50) **Grammar** The grammar also includes these connectors: * `/` division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost never have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). * `.` multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component: { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing `{` or `}`. * `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5 new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric value of `5.3` would mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%` represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value `3` means "3 percent"). * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value `0.03` means "3 percent").

        Immutable. Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc. Some combinations of `metric_kind` and `value_type` might not be supported. Possible values: STRING, BOOL, INT64, DOUBLE, DISTRIBUTION, MONEY
