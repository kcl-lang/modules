    Rate limits for task dispatches.

     [rate_limits][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.rate_limits] and
     [retry_config][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.retry_config] are related
     because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts
     in different ways:

     * [rate_limits][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.rate_limits] controls the total
     rate of
       dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the
       queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first
       attempt or a retry).
     * [retry_config][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.retry_config] controls what
     happens to
       particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is,
       [retry_config][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.retry_config] controls task
       retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc).

     The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:

     * Number of tasks in the queue
     * User-specified throttling:
     [rate_limits][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.rate_limits],
       [retry_config][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.retry_config], and the
       [queue's state][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.state].
     * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service
       Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth
       sudden large traffic spikes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    maxBurstSize : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The max burst size.

         Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when
         many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field
         allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly
         after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when
         many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.

         The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket)
         algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each
         queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum
         specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a
         token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until
         the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be
         continuously refilled with new tokens based on
         [max_dispatches_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second].

         Cloud Tasks will pick the value of `max_burst_size` based on the
         value of
         [max_dispatches_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second].

         For queues that were created or updated using
         `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to
         [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size).
         Since `max_burst_size` is output only, if
         [UpdateQueue][google.cloud.tasks.v2.CloudTasks.UpdateQueue] is called on a
         queue created by `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` will be reset based on
         the value of
         [max_dispatches_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second],
         regardless of whether
         [max_dispatches_per_second][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RateLimits.max_dispatches_per_second]
         is updated.
    maxConcurrentDispatches : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows
         to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been
         reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of
         concurrent requests decreases.

         If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the
         default.

         The maximum allowed value is 5,000.

         This field has the same meaning as

        The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.

         If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the

         Cloud Tasks will attempt the task `max_attempts` times (that is, if the

         If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the

         and [max_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.max_backoff] duration
         after it fails, if the queue's
         [RetryConfig][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig] specifies that the task
         should be retried.

         If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the
         default.

         `max_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second.

    maxDoublings : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times.

         A task's retry interval starts at
         [min_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.min_backoff], then doubles
         `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally
         retries at intervals of
         [max_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.max_backoff] up to
         [max_attempts][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.max_attempts] times.

         For example, if
         [min_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.min_backoff] is 10s,
         [max_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.max_backoff] is 300s, and
         `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in
         10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then
         increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s.  Finally, the task will retry at
         intervals of [max_backoff][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.max_backoff]
         until the task has been attempted
         [max_attempts][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.max_attempts] times. Thus,
         the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, ....

         If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the
         default.

         This field has the same meaning as

    maxRetryDuration : str, default is Undefined, optional
        If positive, `max_retry_duration` specifies the time limit for
         retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first

         task has been attempted
         [max_attempts][google.cloud.tasks.v2.RetryConfig.max_attempts] times, no

         If zero, then the task age is unlimited.
