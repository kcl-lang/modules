    labelFingerprint : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this Interconnect, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve an Interconnect.

        Optional. List of features requested for this Interconnect connection, which can take one of the following values: - IF_MACSEC If specified then the connection is created on MACsec capable hardware ports. If not specified, the default value is false, which allocates non-MACsec capable ports first if available. This parameter can be provided only with Interconnect INSERT. It isn't valid for Interconnect PATCH. Check the RequestedFeatures enum for the list of possible values.

        Target number of physical links in the link bundle, as requested by the customer.
