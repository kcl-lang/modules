    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        An optional description of this resource.
    edgeAvailabilityDomain : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Desired availability domain for the attachment. Only available for type
        PARTNER, at creation time. For improved reliability, customers should
        configure a pair of attachments with one per availability domain. The
        selected availability domain will be provided to the Partner via the

        Indicates the user-supplied encryption option of this interconnect
        attachment. Can only be specified at attachment creation for PARTNER or
        DEDICATED attachments.

        traffic will traverse through. Required if type is DEDICATED, must not

        allocated from the IP address range specified here.
        For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
        interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN gateway
        interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified for this
        interconnect attachment.

        Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), in bytes, of packets passing through
        this interconnect attachment. Currently, only 1440 and 1500 are allowed. If not specified, the value will default to 1440.
    project : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
        If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
    region : str, default is Undefined, required
        Region where the regional interconnect attachment resides.
    router : str, default is Undefined, optional
        URL of the cloud router to be used for dynamic routing. This router must be in
        the same region as this InterconnectAttachment. The InterconnectAttachment will
        automatically connect the Interconnect to the network & region within which the
        Cloud Router is configured.

    edgeAvailabilityDomain : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Desired availability domain for the attachment. Only available for type
        PARTNER, at creation time. For improved reliability, customers should
        configure a pair of attachments with one per availability domain. The
        selected availability domain will be provided to the Partner via the
        pairing key so that the provisioned circuit will lie in the specified
        domain. If not specified, the value will default to AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_ANY.
    encryption : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Indicates the user-supplied encryption option of this interconnect
        attachment. Can only be specified at attachment creation for PARTNER or
        DEDICATED attachments.
    googleReferenceId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Google reference ID, to be used when raising support tickets with
        Google or otherwise to debug backend connectivity issues.

        an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/interconnectAttachments/{{name}}
    interconnect : str, default is Undefined, optional
        URL of the underlying Interconnect object that this attachment's
        traffic will traverse through. Required if type is DEDICATED, must not
        be set if type is PARTNER.
    ipsecInternalAddresses : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        URL of addresses that have been reserved for the interconnect attachment,
        Used only for interconnect attachment that has the encryption option as
        IPSEC.
        The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA VPN
        gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is configured
        to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP address will be
        allocated from the IP address range specified here.
        For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
        interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN gateway
        interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified for this
        interconnect attachment.
        If this field is not specified for interconnect attachment that has
        encryption option as IPSEC, later on when creating HA VPN gateway on this
        interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address will be
        allocated from regional external IP address pool.

        Information specific to an InterconnectAttachment. This property
        is populated if the interconnect that this is attached to is of type DEDICATED.
        Structure is documented below.
    project : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
        If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

        Region where the regional interconnect attachment resides.
    router : str, default is Undefined, optional
        URL of the cloud router to be used for dynamic routing. This router must be in
        the same region as this InterconnectAttachment. The InterconnectAttachment will
