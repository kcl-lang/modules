        Optional. Specifies days of months like 1, 5, or 14 on which jobs will run.

         Values for `days_of_month` are only applicable for `recurrence_type`,
         `MONTHLY` and `YEARLY`. A validation error will occur if other values are
         supplied.

        Optional. Specifies days of week like, MONDAY or TUESDAY, on which jobs

         This is required for `recurrence_type`, `WEEKLY` and is not applicable

         `recurrence_type` is not `WEEKLY`.
    hourlyFrequency : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Optional. Specifies frequency for hourly backups. A hourly frequency of 2
         means jobs will run every 2 hours from start time till end time defined.

         Value of hourly frequency should be between 4 and 23.

         Reason for limit : We found that there is bandwidth limitation of 3GB/S for
         GMI while taking a backup and 5GB/S while doing a restore. Given the amount
         of parallel backups and restore we are targeting, this will potentially
         take the backup time to mins and hours (in worst case scenario).
