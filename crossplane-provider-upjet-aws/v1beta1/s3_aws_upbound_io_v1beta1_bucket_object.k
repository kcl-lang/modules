    arn : str, default is Undefined, optional
        ARN of the object.
    bucket : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Name of the bucket to put the file in. Alternatively, an S3 access point ARN can be specified.

    contentBase64 : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Base64-encoded data that will be decoded and uploaded as raw bytes for the object content. This allows safely uploading non-UTF8 binary data, but is recommended only for small content such as the result of the gzipbase64 function with small text strings. For larger objects, use source to stream the content from a disk file.
    contentDisposition : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Presentational information for the object. Read w3c content_disposition for further information.
    contentEncoding : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Content encodings that have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. Read w3c content encoding for further information.

        Language the content is in e.g., en-US or en-GB.

    forceDestroy : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether to allow the object to be deleted by removing any legal hold on any object version. Default is false. This value should be set to true only if the bucket has S3 object lock enabled.
    id : str, default is Undefined, optional
        id
    key : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Name of the object once it is in the bucket.
    kmsKeyId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        ARN of the KMS Key to use for object encryption. If the S3 Bucket has server-side encryption enabled, that value will automatically be used. If referencing the aws_kms_key resource, use the arn attribute. If referencing the aws_kms_alias data source or resource, use the target_key_arn attribute.
    metadata : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Map of keys/values to provision metadata (will be automatically prefixed by x-amz-meta-, note that only lowercase label are currently supported by the AWS Go API).

        Legal hold status that you want to apply to the specified object. Valid values are ON and OFF.
    objectLockMode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Object lock retention mode that you want to apply to this object. Valid values are GOVERNANCE and COMPLIANCE.

    storageClass : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Storage Class for the object. Defaults to "STANDARD".
    tags : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Key-value map of resource tags.
    tagsAll : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider default_tags configuration block.
