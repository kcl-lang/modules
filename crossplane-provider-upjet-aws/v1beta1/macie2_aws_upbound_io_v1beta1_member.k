        DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external

        This field is planned to be deprecated in favor of the ManagementPolicies
        field in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently and
        non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.
        See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223

        This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
