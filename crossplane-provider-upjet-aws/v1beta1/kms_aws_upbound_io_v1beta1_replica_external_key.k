    arn : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replica key. The key ARNs of related multi-Region keys differ only in the Region value.
    bypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.
        Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.
        For more information, refer to the scenario in the Default Key Policy section in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
        The default value is false.
    deletionWindowInDays : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The waiting period, specified in number of days. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key.
        If you specify a value, it must be between 7 and 30, inclusive. If you do not specify a value, it defaults to 30.
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A description of the KMS key.
    enabled : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies whether the replica key is enabled. Disabled KMS keys cannot be used in cryptographic operations. Keys pending import can only be false. Imported keys default to true unless expired.
    expirationModel : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether the key material expires. Empty when pending key material import, otherwise KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES or KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE.
    id : str, default is Undefined, optional
        id
    keyId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The key ID of the replica key. Related multi-Region keys have the same key ID.
    keyState : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The state of the replica key.
    keyUsage : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The cryptographic operations for which you can use the KMS key. This is a shared property of multi-Region keys.
    policy : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The key policy to attach to the KMS key. If you do not specify a key policy, AWS KMS attaches the default key policy to the KMS key.
    primaryKeyArn : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ARN of the multi-Region primary key to replicate. The primary key must be in a different AWS Region of the same AWS Partition. You can create only one replica of a given primary key in each AWS Region.
    tags : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Key-value map of resource tags.
    tagsAll : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider default_tags configuration block.
    validTo : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Time at which the imported key material expires. When the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the key becomes unusable. If not specified, key material does not expire. Valid values: RFC3339 time string (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)

    A Condition that may apply to a resource.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        LastTransitionTime is the last time this condition transitioned from one
        status to another.

        one status to another, if any.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        ObservedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
        with respect to the current state of the instance.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, required
        A Reason for this condition's last transition from one status to another.
    status : str, default is Undefined, required
        Status of this condition; is it currently True, False, or Unknown?
    $type : str, default is Undefined, required
        Type of this condition. At most one of each condition type may apply to
