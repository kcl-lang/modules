        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

        autoscale
    concurrency : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Job concurrency target which sets a soft upper bound on the number of jobs that can run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft target due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency target will be automatically computed by the system. NOTE: this field is exposed as target job concurrency in the Information Schema, DDL and BigQuery CLI.
    edition : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. Edition of the reservation. Valid values are STANDARD, ENTERPRISE, ENTERPRISE_PLUS

        failover
    ignoreIdleSlots : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        If false, any query or pipeline job using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within the same admin project. If true, a query or pipeline job using this reservation will execute with the slot capacity specified in the slot_capacity field at most.
    location : str, default is Undefined, required
        Immutable. You can configure spec.secondaryLocation to enable the reservation fail-over to a secondary location, in which case the primary location could be different from the spec.location.

        project ref
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. The BigQuery Reservation ID used for resource creation or acquisition. It must only contain lower case alphanumeric characters or dashes. It must start with a letter and must not end with a dash. Its maximum length is 64 characters. For creation: If specified, this value is used as the Reservation ID. If not provided, a UUID will be generated and assigned as the Reservation ID. For acquisition: This field must be provided to identify the Reservation resource to acquire.
    slotCapacity : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Optional. Baseline slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of
         computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the unit of parallelism.

         Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if
         ignore_idle_slots is set to false, or autoscaling is enabled.
