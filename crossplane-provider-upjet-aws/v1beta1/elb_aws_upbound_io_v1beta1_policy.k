        DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external

        external resource.
        This field is planned to be deprecated in favor of the ManagementPolicies
        field in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently and
        non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.

        THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
        through a Crossplane feature flag.
        ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
        take on the managed and external resources.
        This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
        release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
        values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
