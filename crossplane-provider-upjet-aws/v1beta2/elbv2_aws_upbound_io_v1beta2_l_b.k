        This field is planned to be deprecated in favor of the ManagementPolicies
        field in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently and
        non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.
        See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223

        THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

        This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

    dropInvalidHeaderFields : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether HTTP headers with header fields that are not valid are removed by the load balancer (true) or routed to targets (false). The default is false. Elastic Load Balancing requires that message header names contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens. Only valid for Load Balancers of type application.
    enableCrossZoneLoadBalancing : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        If true, cross-zone load balancing of the load balancer will be enabled. For network and gateway type load balancers, this feature is disabled by default (false). For application load balancer this feature is always enabled (true) and cannot be disabled. Defaults to false.

        Whether to allow a WAF-enabled load balancer to route requests to targets if it is unable to forward the request to AWS WAF. Defaults to false.
    enableXffClientPort : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether the X-Forwarded-For header should preserve the source port that the client used to connect to the load balancer in application load balancers. Defaults to false.
    enableZonalShift : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether zonal shift is enabled. Defaults to false.
    enforceSecurityGroupInboundRulesOnPrivateLinkTraffic : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether inbound security group rules are enforced for traffic originating from a PrivateLink. Only valid for Load Balancers of type network. The possible values are on and off.

    ipAddressType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Type of IP addresses used by the subnets for your load balancer. The possible values depend upon the load balancer type: ipv4 (all load balancer types), dualstack (all load balancer types), and dualstack-without-public-ipv4 (type application only).

    preserveHostHeader : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether the Application Load Balancer should preserve the Host header in the HTTP request and send it to the target without any change. Defaults to false.
    region : str, default is Undefined, required
        Region is the region you'd like your resource to be created in.
    securityGroupRefs : [Elbv2AwsUpboundIoV1beta2LBSpecForProviderSecurityGroupRefsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        References to SecurityGroup in ec2 to populate securityGroups.
    securityGroupSelector : Elbv2AwsUpboundIoV1beta2LBSpecForProviderSecurityGroupSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        security group selector
    securityGroups : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        List of security group IDs to assign to the LB. Only valid for Load Balancers of type application or network. For load balancers of type network security groups cannot be added if none are currently present, and cannot all be removed once added. If either of these conditions are met, this will force a recreation of the resource.
    subnetMapping : [Elbv2AwsUpboundIoV1beta2LBSpecForProviderSubnetMappingItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Subnet mapping block. See below. For Load Balancers of type network subnet mappings can only be added.

    subnets : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        List of subnet IDs to attach to the LB. For Load Balancers of type network subnets can only be added (see Availability Zones), deleting a subnet for load balancers of type network will force a recreation of the resource.

        Key-value map of resource tags.
    xffHeaderProcessingMode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Determines how the load balancer modifies the X-Forwarded-For header in the HTTP request before sending the request to the target. The possible values are append, preserve, and remove. Only valid for Load Balancers of type application. The default is append.

    InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception

See   Availability Zone DNS affinity for additional details. Only valid for network type load balancers.
    dropInvalidHeaderFields : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether HTTP headers with header fields that are not valid are removed by the load balancer (true) or routed to targets (false). The default is false. Elastic Load Balancing requires that message header names contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens. Only valid for Load Balancers of type application.
    enableCrossZoneLoadBalancing : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        If true, cross-zone load balancing of the load balancer will be enabled. For network and gateway type load balancers, this feature is disabled by default (false). For application load balancer this feature is always enabled (true) and cannot be disabled. Defaults to false.

        If true, deletion of the load balancer will be disabled via the AWS API. Defaults to false.

        Whether the X-Forwarded-For header should preserve the source port that the client used to connect to the load balancer in application load balancers. Defaults to false.
    enableZonalShift : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether zonal shift is enabled. Defaults to false.
    enforceSecurityGroupInboundRulesOnPrivateLinkTraffic : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether inbound security group rules are enforced for traffic originating from a PrivateLink. Only valid for Load Balancers of type network. The possible values are on and off.

        security group selector
    securityGroups : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        List of security group IDs to assign to the LB. Only valid for Load Balancers of type application or network. For load balancers of type network security groups cannot be added if none are currently present, and cannot all be removed once added. If either of these conditions are met, this will force a recreation of the resource.
    subnetMapping : [Elbv2AwsUpboundIoV1beta2LBSpecInitProviderSubnetMappingItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Subnet mapping block. See below. For Load Balancers of type network subnet mappings can only be added.

    preserveHostHeader : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether the Application Load Balancer should preserve the Host header in the HTTP request and send it to the target without any change. Defaults to false.
    securityGroups : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        List of security group IDs to assign to the LB. Only valid for Load Balancers of type application or network. For load balancers of type network security groups cannot be added if none are currently present, and cannot all be removed once added. If either of these conditions are met, this will force a recreation of the resource.
    subnetMapping : [Elbv2AwsUpboundIoV1beta2LBStatusAtProviderSubnetMappingItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Subnet mapping block. See below. For Load Balancers of type network subnet mappings can only be added.
    subnets : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        List of subnet IDs to attach to the LB. For Load Balancers of type network subnets can only be added (see Availability Zones), deleting a subnet for load balancers of type network will force a recreation of the resource.
    tags : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Key-value map of resource tags.
    tagsAll : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider default_tags configuration block.
