    Attributes
    ----------
    complexDataTypeReferenceParsing : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED by default after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources. Possible values: ["COMPLEX_DATA_TYPE_REFERENCE_PARSING_UNSPECIFIED", "DISABLED", "ENABLED"].
    dataset : str, default is Undefined, required
        Immutable. Identifies the dataset addressed by this request. Must be in the format
        'projects/{project}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset}'.
    defaultSearchHandlingStrict : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to handling=strict which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters.
        If false, uses the FHIR specification default handling=lenient which ignores unrecognized search parameters.
        The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header Prefer: handling=strict or Prefer: handling=lenient.
    disableReferentialIntegrity : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store
        creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity and fail the
        requests that will result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API
        will skip referential integrity check. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as
        Patient.get$everything, will not return all the results if broken references exist.

        ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **.
    disableResourceVersioning : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation
        of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause historical
        versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but
        cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions will be kept. The server will send back errors for
        attempts to read the historical versions.

        ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **.
    enableHistoryImport : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Whether to allow the bulk import API to accept history bundles and directly insert historical resource
        versions into the FHIR store. Importing resource histories creates resource interactions that appear to have
        occurred in the past, which clients may not want to allow. If set to false, history bundles within an import
        will fail with an error.

        ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **

        ** This property can be changed manually in the Google Cloud Healthcare admin console without recreating the FHIR store **.
    enableUpdateCreate : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability. This determines if the client can use an Update
        operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through
        the Create operation and attempts to Update a non-existent resource will return errors. Please treat the audit
        logs with appropriate levels of care if client-specified resource IDs contain sensitive data such as patient
        identifiers, those IDs will be part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Cloud Pub/Sub
        notifications.
    notificationConfig : HealthcareCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1HealthcareFHIRStoreSpecNotificationConfig, default is Undefined, optional
        notification config
    notificationConfigs : [HealthcareCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1HealthcareFHIRStoreSpecNotificationConfigsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        A list of notifcation configs that configure the notification for every resource mutation in this FHIR store.
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. The name of the resource. Used for creation and acquisition. When unset, the value of `metadata.name` is used as the default.
    streamConfigs : [HealthcareCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1HealthcareFHIRStoreSpecStreamConfigsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in
        this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next
        resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed
        from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required
        bigquery.dataEditor role to your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account. Some lag (typically on
        the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    version : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The FHIR specification version. Default value: "STU3" Possible values: ["DSTU2", "STU3", "R4"].
