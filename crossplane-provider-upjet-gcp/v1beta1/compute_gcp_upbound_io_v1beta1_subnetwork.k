        A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
        A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_NAT is used as source range for Private NAT gateways.

        A subnet with purpose set to REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
        A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
        A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
        A subnetwork with purpose set to PRIVATE_NAT is used as source range for Private NAT gateways.
        Note that REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.
        If unspecified, the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918.

        The value can be set to ACTIVE or BACKUP.
        An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used for Envoy-based load balancers in a region.
        A BACKUP subnetwork is one that is ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining.
        Possible values are: ACTIVE, BACKUP.
