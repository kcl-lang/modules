    deletionPolicy : str, default is "Delete", optional
        DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external

        external resource.
        This field is planned to be deprecated in favor of the ManagementPolicies
        field in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently and
        non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.
        See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223

        for provider
    initProvider : any, default is Undefined, optional
        THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It will be honored
        unless the Management Policies feature flag is disabled.
        InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception
        of Identifier and other resource reference fields. The fields that are
        in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
        The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
        avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
        required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
        for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
        autoscaler.
    managementPolicies : [str], default is ["*"], optional
        THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
        through a Crossplane feature flag.
        ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
        take on the managed and external resources.
        This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
        release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
        values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
        custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
