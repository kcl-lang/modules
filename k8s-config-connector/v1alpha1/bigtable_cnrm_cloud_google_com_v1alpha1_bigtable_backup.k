    typeURL : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized

         one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
         the fully qualified name of the type (as in
         `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
         (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

         In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
         expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
         scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
         server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

         * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
         * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
           value in binary format, or produce an error.
         * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
           URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
           lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
           on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
           breaking changes.)

         Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
         protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
         type.googleapis.com.

         Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
         used with implementation specific semantics.
    value : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type.
