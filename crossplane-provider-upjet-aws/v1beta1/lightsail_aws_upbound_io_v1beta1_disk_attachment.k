    WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
    Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
    be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
    and password required to connect to the managed resource.
    This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
    PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
    and connection details would be published to both without affecting
    each other.
