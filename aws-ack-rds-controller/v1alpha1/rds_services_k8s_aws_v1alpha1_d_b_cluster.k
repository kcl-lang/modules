         Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
    preSignedURL : str, default is Undefined, optional
        When you are replicating a DB cluster from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another, an URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CreateDBCluster operation to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster is replicated from. Specify PreSignedUrl only when you are performing cross-Region replication from an encrypted DB cluster. 
         The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBCluster API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to copy. 
         The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values: 
         - KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both the CreateDBCluster operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL. 
         - DestinationRegion - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that Aurora read replica will be created in. 
         - ReplicationSourceIdentifier - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your ReplicationSourceIdentifier would look like Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1. 
         To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). 
         If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region. 
         Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only
    preferredBackupWindow : str, default is Undefined, optional

         Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
    publiclyAccessible : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A value that indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible. 
         When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it. 
         When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. 
         Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnetGroupName is specified. 
         If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the following applies: 
         - If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private. 
         - If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public. 
         If DBSubnetGroupName is specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the following applies: 
         - If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private. 
         - If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public. 
         Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only
    replicationSourceIdentifier : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB instance or DB cluster if this DB cluster is created as a read replica.

        The identifier for the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot to restore from. 
         You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a DB cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a DB snapshot. 
         Constraints: 
         - Must match the identifier of an existing Snapshot. 
         Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
    sourceRegion : str, default is Undefined, optional
        SourceRegion is the source region where the resource exists. This is not sent over the wire and is only used for presigning. This value should always have the same region as the source ARN.
    storageEncrypted : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A value that indicates whether the DB cluster is encrypted. 
         Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

        Contains one or more identifiers of the read replicas associated with this DB cluster.
    readerEndpoint : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster. 
         If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.
