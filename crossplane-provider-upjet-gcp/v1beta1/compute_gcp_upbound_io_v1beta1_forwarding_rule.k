    ----------
    allPorts : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
        Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
        to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
        The allPorts field has the following limitations:
    allowGlobalAccess : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This field is used along with the backend_service field for
        internal load balancing or with the target field for internal
        TargetInstance.
        If the field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from all
        regions.
        Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the
        internal load balancer.
    allowPscGlobalAccess : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
    backendService : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic.
        Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing;
        must be omitted for all other load balancer types.
    backendServiceRef : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderBackendServiceRef, default is Undefined, optional
        backend service ref
    backendServiceSelector : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderBackendServiceSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        backend service selector
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
        you create the resource.
    ipAddress : str, default is Undefined, optional
        IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
        sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
        to the referenced target or backendService.
        While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is
        required under the following circumstances:
    ipAddressRef : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderIPAddressRef, default is Undefined, optional
        ip address ref
    ipAddressSelector : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderIPAddressSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        ip address selector
    ipProtocol : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
        For protocol forwarding, valid
        options are TCP, UDP, ESP,
        AH, SCTP, ICMP and
        L3_DEFAULT.
        The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products
        as described in Load balancing
        features.
        A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or
        backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol.
        A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP.
        Possible values are: TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP, L3_DEFAULT.
    ipVersion : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule.
        Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6.
        If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default.
        Possible values are: IPV4, IPV6.
    isMirroringCollector : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
        packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this
        load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a
        PacketMirroring rule applies to them.
        This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
        loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
    labels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
    loadBalancingScheme : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies the forwarding rule type.
        For more information about forwarding rules, refer to
        Forwarding rule concepts.
        Default value is EXTERNAL.
        Possible values are: EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, INTERNAL_MANAGED.
    network : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This field is not used for external load balancing.
        For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that
        the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
        If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used.
        If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will
        be used.
        For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
        APIs, a network must be provided.
    networkRef : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderNetworkRef, default is Undefined, optional
        network ref
    networkSelector : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderNetworkSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        network selector
    networkTier : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This signifies the networking tier used for configuring
        this load balancer and can only take the following values:
        PREMIUM, STANDARD.
        For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and
        STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is
        PREMIUM.
        If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
        If IPAddress is specified, this value must be equal to the
        networkTier of the Address.
        Possible values are: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
    noAutomateDnsZone : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
    portRange : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
        Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
        to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
        The portRange field has the following limitations:
    ports : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
        Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
        to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
        The ports field has the following limitations:
    project : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
        If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
    recreateClosedPsc : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        this is used in psc consumer forwardingrule to make provider recreate the forwardingrule when the status is closed
    region : str, default is Undefined, required
        A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
        This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
    serviceDirectoryRegistrations : [ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderServiceDirectoryRegistrationsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with.
        Currently, only supports a single Service Directory resource.
        Structure is documented below.
    serviceLabel : str, default is Undefined, optional
        An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
        If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
        name.
        The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
        Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
        regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first
        character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
        must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
        character, which cannot be a dash.
        This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
    sourceIpRanges : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
    subnetwork : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should
        belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and
        network load balancing with IPv6.
        If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
        However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet
        mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
    subnetworkRef : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderSubnetworkRef, default is Undefined, optional
        subnetwork ref
    subnetworkSelector : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecForProviderSubnetworkSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        subnetwork selector
    target : str, default is Undefined, optional
        is set to targetGrpcProxy and
        validateForProxyless is set to true, the
        IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0.

        The allPorts field has the following limitations:
    allowGlobalAccess : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This field is used along with the backend_service field for
        internal load balancing or with the target field for internal
        TargetInstance.
        If the field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from all
        regions.
        Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the
        internal load balancer.
    allowPscGlobalAccess : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
    backendService : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic.
        Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing;
        must be omitted for all other load balancer types.

        backend service selector
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
        you create the resource.
    ipAddress : str, default is Undefined, optional
        IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
        sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
        to the referenced target or backendService.
        While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is
        required under the following circumstances:
    ipAddressRef : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecInitProviderIPAddressRef, default is Undefined, optional
        ip address ref
    ipAddressSelector : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecInitProviderIPAddressSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        ip address selector
    ipProtocol : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
        For protocol forwarding, valid
        options are TCP, UDP, ESP,
        AH, SCTP, ICMP and
        L3_DEFAULT.
        The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products
        as described in Load balancing
        features.
        A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or
        backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol.
        A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP.
        Possible values are: TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP, L3_DEFAULT.
    ipVersion : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule.
        Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6.
        If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default.
        Possible values are: IPV4, IPV6.
    isMirroringCollector : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
        packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this
        load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a
        PacketMirroring rule applies to them.
        This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
        loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
    labels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
    loadBalancingScheme : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies the forwarding rule type.
        For more information about forwarding rules, refer to
        Forwarding rule concepts.
        Default value is EXTERNAL.
        Possible values are: EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, INTERNAL_MANAGED.
    network : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This field is not used for external load balancing.
        For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that
        the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
        If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used.
        If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will
        be used.
        For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
        APIs, a network must be provided.
    networkRef : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecInitProviderNetworkRef, default is Undefined, optional
        network ref
    networkSelector : ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecInitProviderNetworkSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        network selector
    networkTier : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This signifies the networking tier used for configuring
        this load balancer and can only take the following values:
        PREMIUM, STANDARD.
        For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and
        STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is
        PREMIUM.
        If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
        If IPAddress is specified, this value must be equal to the
        networkTier of the Address.
        Possible values are: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
    noAutomateDnsZone : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
    portRange : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
        Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
        to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
        The portRange field has the following limitations:
    ports : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
        Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
        to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
        The ports field has the following limitations:
    project : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
        If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
    recreateClosedPsc : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        this is used in psc consumer forwardingrule to make provider recreate the forwardingrule when the status is closed
    serviceDirectoryRegistrations : [ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleSpecInitProviderServiceDirectoryRegistrationsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with.
        Currently, only supports a single Service Directory resource.
        Structure is documented below.
    serviceLabel : str, default is Undefined, optional
        An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
        If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
        name.
        The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
        Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
        regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first
        character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
        must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
        character, which cannot be a dash.
        This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
    sourceIpRanges : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
    subnetwork : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should
        belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and
        network load balancing with IPv6.
        If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
        However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet
        mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.

    ipAddress : str, default is Undefined, optional
        IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
        sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
        to the referenced target or backendService.
        While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is
        required under the following circumstances:
    ipProtocol : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
        For protocol forwarding, valid
        options are TCP, UDP, ESP,
        AH, SCTP, ICMP and
        L3_DEFAULT.
        The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products
        as described in Load balancing
        features.
        A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or
        backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol.
        A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP.
        Possible values are: TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP, L3_DEFAULT.
    ipVersion : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule.
        Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6.
        If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default.
        Possible values are: IPV4, IPV6.
    isMirroringCollector : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
        packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this
        load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a
        PacketMirroring rule applies to them.
        This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
        loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
    labelFingerprint : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource.  Used
        internally during updates.
    labels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
    loadBalancingScheme : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies the forwarding rule type.
        For more information about forwarding rules, refer to
        Forwarding rule concepts.
        Default value is EXTERNAL.
        Possible values are: EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, INTERNAL_MANAGED.
    network : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This field is not used for external load balancing.
        For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that
        the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
        If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used.
        If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will
        be used.
        For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
        APIs, a network must be provided.
    networkTier : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This signifies the networking tier used for configuring
        this load balancer and can only take the following values:
        PREMIUM, STANDARD.
        For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and
        STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is
        PREMIUM.
        If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
        If IPAddress is specified, this value must be equal to the
        networkTier of the Address.
        Possible values are: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
    noAutomateDnsZone : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
    portRange : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
        Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
        to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
        The portRange field has the following limitations:
    ports : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
        Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
        to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
        The ports field has the following limitations:
    project : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
        If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
    pscConnectionId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The PSC connection id of the PSC Forwarding Rule.
    pscConnectionStatus : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The PSC connection status of the PSC Forwarding Rule. Possible values: STATUS_UNSPECIFIED, PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, CLOSED
    recreateClosedPsc : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        this is used in psc consumer forwardingrule to make provider recreate the forwardingrule when the status is closed
    region : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
        This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
    selfLink : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The URI of the created resource.
    serviceDirectoryRegistrations : [ComputeGcpUpboundIoV1beta1ForwardingRuleStatusAtProviderServiceDirectoryRegistrationsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with.
        Currently, only supports a single Service Directory resource.
        Structure is documented below.
    serviceLabel : str, default is Undefined, optional
        An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
        If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
        name.
        The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
        Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
        regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first
        character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
        must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
        character, which cannot be a dash.
        This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
    serviceName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The internal fully qualified service name for this Forwarding Rule.
        This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
    sourceIpRanges : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
    subnetwork : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should
        belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and
        network load balancing with IPv6.
        If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
        However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet
        mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
    target : str, default is Undefined, optional
        is set to targetGrpcProxy and
        validateForProxyless is set to true, the
        IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0.
    terraformLabels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
        and default labels configured on the provider.
