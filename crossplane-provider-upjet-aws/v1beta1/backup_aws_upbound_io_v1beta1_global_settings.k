    deletionPolicy : str, default is "Delete", optional
        DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external

        This field is planned to be deprecated in favor of the ManagementPolicies
        field in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently and
        non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.

        THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

        This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
        release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
        values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are

    THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It will be honored

    InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception

    in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
    The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
    avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
    required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
    for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
    autoscaler.
