    providerID : str, default is Undefined, optional

        This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
        This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
        with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
        machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
        generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
        able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
        and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
        This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
        be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.
    readinessGates : [ClusterxK8sIoV1beta2MachineSetSpecTemplateSpecReadinessGatesItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        readinessGates specifies additional conditions to include when evaluating Machine Ready condition.

        This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
        Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
        for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

        Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
        they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

        NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
        readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
        readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
        This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).
    taints : [ClusterxK8sIoV1beta2MachineSetSpecTemplateSpecTaintsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        taints are the node taints that Cluster API will manage.
        This list is not necessarily complete: other Kubernetes components may add or remove other taints from nodes,
        e.g. the node controller might add the node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint.
        Only those taints defined in this list will be added or removed by core Cluster API controllers.

        There can be at most 64 taints.
        A pod would have to tolerate all existing taints to run on the corresponding node.

        NOTE: This list is implemented as a "map" type, meaning that individual elements can be managed by different owners.
    version : str, default is Undefined, optional
        version defines the desired Kubernetes version.

        readyReplicas is the number of ready replicas for this MachineSet. A machine is considered ready when Machine's Ready condition is true.

        replicas is the most recently observed number of replicas.

        selector is the same as the label selector but in the string format to avoid introspection
        by clients. The string will be in the same format as the query-param syntax.

    upToDateReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        upToDateReplicas is the number of up-to-date replicas for this MachineSet. A machine is considered up-to-date when Machine's UpToDate condition is true.

    Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
    message : str, default is Undefined, required
        message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
        This may be an empty string.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
        with respect to the current state of the instance.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, required
        reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
        Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
        and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
        The value should be a CamelCase string.

        failureReason will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem
        reconciling the Machine and will contain a succinct value suitable
        for machine interpretation.

        In the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the
        replicas, both FailureReason and FailureMessage will be set. FailureReason
        will be populated with a succinct value suitable for machine
        interpretation, while FailureMessage will contain a more verbose
        string suitable for logging and human consumption.

        These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
        controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
        time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
        fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
        the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
        of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
        spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
        responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

        Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
        can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the
        controller's output.
