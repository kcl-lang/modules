    endpointType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The type of endpoint that you want your SFTP server connect to. If you connect to a VPC (or VPC_ENDPOINT), your SFTP server isn't accessible over the public internet. If you want to connect your SFTP server via public internet, set PUBLIC.  Defaults to PUBLIC.
    forceDestroy : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A boolean that indicates all users associated with the server should be deleted so that the Server can be destroyed without error. The default value is false. This option only applies to servers configured with a SERVICE_MANAGED identity_provider_type.

    tags : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Key-value map of resource tags.
    url : str, default is Undefined, optional

    endpointType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The type of endpoint that you want your SFTP server connect to. If you connect to a VPC (or VPC_ENDPOINT), your SFTP server isn't accessible over the public internet. If you want to connect your SFTP server via public internet, set PUBLIC.  Defaults to PUBLIC.
    forceDestroy : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        A boolean that indicates all users associated with the server should be deleted so that the Server can be destroyed without error. The default value is false. This option only applies to servers configured with a SERVICE_MANAGED identity_provider_type.
