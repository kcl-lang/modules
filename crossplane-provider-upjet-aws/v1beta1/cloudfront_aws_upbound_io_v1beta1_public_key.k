        DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external

        This field is planned to be deprecated in favor of the ManagementPolicies
        field in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently and
        non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.

        This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
        release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
