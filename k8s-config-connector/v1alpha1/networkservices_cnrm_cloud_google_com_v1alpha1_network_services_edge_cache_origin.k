    awsV4Authentication : NetworkservicesCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1NetworkServicesEdgeCacheOriginSpecAwsV4Authentication, default is Undefined, optional
        aws v4 authentication
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A human-readable description of the resource.
    failoverOrigin : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The Origin resource to try when the current origin cannot be reached.
        After maxAttempts is reached, the configured failoverOrigin will be used to fulfil the request.

        The value of timeout.maxAttemptsTimeout dictates the timeout across all origins.
        A reference to a Topic resource.
    maxAttempts : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The maximum number of attempts to cache fill from this origin. Another attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of the retryConditions.

        Once maxAttempts to this origin have failed the failoverOrigin will be used, if one is specified. That failoverOrigin may specify its own maxAttempts,
        retryConditions and failoverOrigin to control its own cache fill failures.

        The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to four.
        The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and failover origins can be controlled with maxAttemptsTimeout.

        The last valid, non-retried response from all origins will be returned to the client.
        If no origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 502 will be returned to the client.

        Defaults to 1. Must be a value greater than 0 and less than 4.
    originAddress : str, default is Undefined, required
        A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address reachable over the public Internet, or the address of a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

        This address will be used as the origin for cache requests - e.g. FQDN: media-backend.example.com, IPv4: 35.218.1.1, IPv6: 2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e, Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname

        When providing an FQDN (hostname), it must be publicly resolvable (e.g. via Google public DNS) and IP addresses must be publicly routable.  It must not contain a protocol (e.g., https://) and it must not contain any slashes.
        If a Cloud Storage bucket is provided, it must be in the canonical "gs://bucketname" format. Other forms, such as "storage.googleapis.com", will be rejected.

        origin override action
    originRedirect : NetworkservicesCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1NetworkServicesEdgeCacheOriginSpecOriginRedirect, default is Undefined, optional
        origin redirect
    port : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The port to connect to the origin on.
        Defaults to port 443 for HTTP2 and HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.
    projectRef : NetworkservicesCnrmCloudGoogleComV1alpha1NetworkServicesEdgeCacheOriginSpecProjectRef, default is Undefined, required
        project ref
    $protocol : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The protocol to use to connect to the configured origin. Defaults to HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use HTTP2 for both security & performance.

        When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must be presented by the origin server. Possible values: ["HTTP2", "HTTPS", "HTTP"].
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. The name of the resource. Used for creation and acquisition. When unset, the value of `metadata.name` is used as the default.
    retryConditions : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin.

        If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s),
        the origin request will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to satisfy the request.

        The default retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE".

        retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s),
        which may specify their own retryConditions and maxAttempts.

        Valid values are:

        - CONNECT_FAILURE: Retry on failures connecting to origins, for example due to connection timeouts.
        - HTTP_5XX: Retry if the origin responds with any 5xx response code, or if the origin does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams.
        - GATEWAY_ERROR: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.
        - RETRIABLE_4XX: Retry for retriable 4xx response codes, which include HTTP 409 (Conflict) and HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
        - NOT_FOUND: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 404 (Not Found). This can be useful when generating video content, and the segment is not available yet.
        - FORBIDDEN: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 403 (Forbidden). Possible values: ["CONNECT_FAILURE", "HTTP_5XX", "GATEWAY_ERROR", "RETRIABLE_4XX", "NOT_FOUND", "FORBIDDEN"].

        Defaults to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.

        The responseTimeout starts after the connection has been established.

        This also applies to HTTP Chunked Transfer Encoding responses, and/or when an open-ended Range request is made to the origin. Origins that take longer to write additional bytes to the response than the configured responseTimeout will result in an error being returned to the client.
