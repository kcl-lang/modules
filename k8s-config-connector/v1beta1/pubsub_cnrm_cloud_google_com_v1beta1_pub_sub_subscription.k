    ackDeadlineSeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
        This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
        before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
        delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
        acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
        again during that time (on a best-effort basis).

        For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
        the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
        subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
        pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
        maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
        If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

        For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
        for the call to the push endpoint.

        If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
        will eventually redeliver the message.

        dead letter policy
    enableExactlyOnceDelivery : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        If 'true', Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the delivery
        of a message with a given value of messageId on this Subscriptions':

        - The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent before the message's acknowledgement deadline expires.

        - An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber.

        Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message when 'enable_exactly_once_delivery'
        is true if the message was published multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are considered distinct by Pub/Sub and have distinct messageId values.
    enableMessageOrdering : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. If 'true', messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to
        the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they
        may be delivered in any order.

        Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the filter. You can filter messages
        by their attributes. The maximum length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription,
        you can't modify the filter.
    messageRetentionDuration : str, default is Undefined, optional
        How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
        backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
        retain_acked_messages is true, then this also configures the retention
        of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
        subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
        than 7 days ('"604800s"') or less than 10 minutes ('"600s"').

        attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
        the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
        (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
        based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.
