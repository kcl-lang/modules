The first IP from each CIDR block is assigned for customer gateway, the second and third is for Transit Gateway (An example: from range 169.254.100.0/29, .1 is assigned to customer gateway and .2 and .3 are assigned to Transit Gateway)
    peerAddress : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The IP addressed assigned to customer device, which will be used as tunnel endpoint. It can be IPv4 or IPv6 address, but must be the same address family as transit_gateway_address
    tags : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Key-value map of resource tags.
    tagsAll : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider default_tags configuration block.
    transitGatewayAddress : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The IP address assigned to Transit Gateway, which will be used as tunnel endpoint. This address must be from associated Transit Gateway CIDR block. The address must be from the same address family as peer_address. If not set explicitly, it will be selected from associated Transit Gateway CIDR blocks

    A Condition that may apply to a resource.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        LastTransitionTime is the last time this condition transitioned from one
        status to another.
    message : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A Message containing details about this condition's last transition from
        one status to another, if any.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        ObservedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
        with respect to the current state of the instance.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, required
        A Reason for this condition's last transition from one status to another.
    status : str, default is Undefined, required
        Status of this condition; is it currently True, False, or Unknown?
    $type : str, default is Undefined, required
        Type of this condition. At most one of each condition type may apply to
        a resource at any point in time.
