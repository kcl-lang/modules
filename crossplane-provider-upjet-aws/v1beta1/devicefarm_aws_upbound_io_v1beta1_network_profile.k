    A Condition that may apply to a resource.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        LastTransitionTime is the last time this condition transitioned from one
        status to another.
    message : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A Message containing details about this condition's last transition from
        one status to another, if any.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        ObservedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
        with respect to the current state of the instance.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, required
        A Reason for this condition's last transition from one status to another.
    status : str, default is Undefined, required
        Status of this condition; is it currently True, False, or Unknown?
    $type : str, default is Undefined, required
        Type of this condition. At most one of each condition type may apply to
        a resource at any point in time.
