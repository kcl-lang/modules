        Addresses requested for this Gateway. This is optional and behavior can depend on the implementation. If a value is set in the spec and the requested address is invalid or unavailable, the implementation MUST indicate this in the associated entry in GatewayStatus.Addresses. 
         The Addresses field represents a request for the address(es) on the "outside of the Gateway", that traffic bound for this Gateway will use. This could be the IP address or hostname of an external load balancer or other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will be sent to. 
         If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate set of Addresses.

    infrastructure : GatewayNetworkingK8sIoV1GatewaySpecInfrastructure, default is Undefined, optional
        infrastructure
    listeners : [GatewayNetworkingK8sIoV1GatewaySpecListenersItems0], default is Undefined, required
        Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses. At least one Listener MUST be specified. 
         Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway) MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_ apply in that case). 
         Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname. 
         Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their targeted conformance profile: 
         HTTP Profile 
         1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided 
         TLS Profile 
         1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough 
         "Distinct" Listeners have the following property: 
         The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other Listener fields. 
         For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct: 
         1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values. 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values. 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener with the same Protocol has the same Port value. 
         Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant for HTTP or HTTPS protocols. 
         When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the Listener to be distinct. 
         When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes. 
         Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value) matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`. 
         Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries. For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`. The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence. 
         The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`. 
         If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted" condition in the Listener Status to "True". 
         Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner. This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at least one Listener must be present. 
         The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted. 
         A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if: 
         1. They are distinct. 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned addresses. 
         Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation may not be compatible for another. 
         For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct. 
         Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener). This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this. 
         Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

         Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of the following protocols: 
         * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI. * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request. * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match at both the TLS and HTTP protocol layers as described above. If an implementation does not ensure that both the SNI and Host header match the Listener hostname, it MUST clearly document that. 
         For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames, there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames documentation. 
         Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

For example, a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04". * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz. 
     All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid, support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency.

        Conditions describe the current conditions of the Gateway.

    attachedRoutes : int, default is Undefined, required
        AttachedRoutes represents the total number of Routes that have been successfully attached to this Listener. 
         Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions. 
         Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.
