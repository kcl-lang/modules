    Attributes
    ----------
    allowIPIPPacketsFromWorkloads : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        AllowIPIPPacketsFromWorkloads controls whether Felix will add a rule to drop IPIP encapsulated traffic from workloads [Default: false]
    allowVXLANPacketsFromWorkloads : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        AllowVXLANPacketsFromWorkloads controls whether Felix will add a rule to drop VXLAN encapsulated traffic from workloads [Default: false]
    awsSrcDstCheck : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Set source-destination-check on AWS EC2 instances. Accepted value must be one of "DoNothing", "Enable" or "Disable". [Default: DoNothing]
    bpfConnectTimeLoadBalancingEnabled : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFConnectTimeLoadBalancingEnabled when in BPF mode, controls whether Felix installs the connection-time load balancer.  The connect-time load balancer is required for the host to be able to reach Kubernetes services and it improves the performance of pod-to-service connections.  The only reason to disable it is for debugging purposes.  [Default: true]
    bpfDataIfacePattern : str, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFDataIfacePattern is a regular expression that controls which interfaces Felix should attach BPF programs to in order to catch traffic to/from the network.  This needs to match the interfaces that Calico workload traffic flows over as well as any interfaces that handle incoming traffic to nodeports and services from outside the cluster.  It should not match the workload interfaces (usually named cali...).
    bpfDisableUnprivileged : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFDisableUnprivileged, if enabled, Felix sets the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl to disable unprivileged use of BPF.  This ensures that unprivileged users cannot access Calico's BPF maps and cannot insert their own BPF programs to interfere with Calico's. [Default: true]
    bpfEnabled : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFEnabled, if enabled Felix will use the BPF dataplane. [Default: false]
    bpfEnforceRPF : str, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFEnforceRPF enforce strict RPF on all interfaces with BPF programs regardless of what is the per-interfaces or global setting. Possible values are Disabled or Strict. [Default: Strict]
    bpfExtToServiceConnmark : int, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFExtToServiceConnmark in BPF mode, control a 32bit mark that is set on connections from an external client to a local service. This mark allows us to control how packets of that connection are routed within the host and how is routing interpreted by RPF check. [Default: 0]
    bpfExternalServiceMode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFExternalServiceMode in BPF mode, controls how connections from outside the cluster to services (node ports and cluster IPs) are forwarded to remote workloads.  If set to "Tunnel" then both request and response traffic is tunneled to the remote node.  If set to "DSR", the request traffic is tunneled but the response traffic is sent directly from the remote node.  In "DSR" mode, the remote node appears to use the IP of the ingress node; this requires a permissive L2 network.  [Default: Tunnel]
    bpfKubeProxyEndpointSlicesEnabled : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFKubeProxyEndpointSlicesEnabled in BPF mode, controls whether Felix's embedded kube-proxy accepts EndpointSlices or not.
    bpfKubeProxyIptablesCleanupEnabled : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFKubeProxyIptablesCleanupEnabled, if enabled in BPF mode, Felix will proactively clean up the upstream Kubernetes kube-proxy's iptables chains.  Should only be enabled if kube-proxy is not running.  [Default: true]
    bpfKubeProxyMinSyncPeriod : str, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFKubeProxyMinSyncPeriod, in BPF mode, controls the minimum time between updates to the dataplane for Felix's embedded kube-proxy.  Lower values give reduced set-up latency.  Higher values reduce Felix CPU usage by batching up more work.  [Default: 1s]
    bpfLogLevel : str, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFLogLevel controls the log level of the BPF programs when in BPF dataplane mode.  One of "Off", "Info", or "Debug".  The logs are emitted to the BPF trace pipe, accessible with the command `tc exec bpf debug`. [Default: Off].
    bpfMapSizeConntrack : int, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFMapSizeConntrack sets the size for the conntrack map.  This map must be large enough to hold an entry for each active connection.  Warning: changing the size of the conntrack map can cause disruption.
    bpfMapSizeIPSets : int, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFMapSizeIPSets sets the size for ipsets map.  The IP sets map must be large enough to hold an entry for each endpoint matched by every selector in the source/destination matches in network policy.  Selectors such as "all()" can result in large numbers of entries (one entry per endpoint in that case).
    bpfMapSizeIfState : int, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFMapSizeIfState sets the size for ifstate map.  The ifstate map must be large enough to hold an entry for each device (host + workloads) on a host.

    bpfMapSizeRoute : int, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFMapSizeRoute sets the size for the routes map.  The routes map should be large enough to hold one entry per workload and a handful of entries per host (enough to cover its own IPs and tunnel IPs).
    bpfPSNATPorts : int | str, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFPSNATPorts sets the range from which we randomly pick a port if there is a source port collision. This should be within the ephemeral range as defined by RFC 6056 (1024–65535) and preferably outside the  ephemeral ranges used by common operating systems. Linux uses 32768–60999, while others mostly use the IANA defined range 49152–65535. It is not necessarily a problem if this range overlaps with the operating systems. Both ends of the range are inclusive. [Default: 20000:29999]
    bpfPolicyDebugEnabled : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        BPFPolicyDebugEnabled when true, Felix records detailed information about the BPF policy programs, which can be examined with the calico-bpf command-line tool.
    chainInsertMode : str, default is Undefined, optional
        ChainInsertMode controls whether Felix hooks the kernel's top-level iptables chains by inserting a rule at the top of the chain or by appending a rule at the bottom. insert is the safe default since it prevents Calico's rules from being bypassed. If you switch to append mode, be sure that the other rules in the chains signal acceptance by falling through to the Calico rules, otherwise the Calico policy will be bypassed. [Default: insert]
    dataplaneDriver : str, default is Undefined, optional
        DataplaneDriver filename of the external dataplane driver to use.  Only used if UseInternalDataplaneDriver is set to false.
    dataplaneWatchdogTimeout : str, default is Undefined, optional
        DataplaneWatchdogTimeout is the readiness/liveness timeout used for Felix's (internal) dataplane driver. Increase this value if you experience spurious non-ready or non-live events when Felix is under heavy load. Decrease the value to get felix to report non-live or non-ready more quickly. [Default: 90s]
    debugDisableLogDropping : bool, default is Undefined, optional

    debugSimulateDataplaneHangAfter : str, default is Undefined, optional
        debug simulate dataplane hang after
    defaultEndpointToHostAction : str, default is Undefined, optional
        DefaultEndpointToHostAction controls what happens to traffic that goes from a workload endpoint to the host itself (after the traffic hits the endpoint egress policy). By default Calico blocks traffic from workload endpoints to the host itself with an iptables "DROP" action. If you want to allow some or all traffic from endpoint to host, set this parameter to RETURN or ACCEPT. Use RETURN if you have your own rules in the iptables "INPUT" chain; Calico will insert its rules at the top of that chain, then "RETURN" packets to the "INPUT" chain once it has completed processing workload endpoint egress policy. Use ACCEPT to unconditionally accept packets from workloads after processing workload endpoint egress policy. [Default: Drop]
    deviceRouteProtocol : int, default is Undefined, optional
        This defines the route protocol added to programmed device routes, by default this will be RTPROT_BOOT when left blank.

    failsafeInboundHostPorts : [CrdProjectcalicoOrgV1FelixConfigurationSpecFailsafeInboundHostPortsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        FailsafeInboundHostPorts is a list of UDP/TCP ports and CIDRs that Felix will allow incoming traffic to host endpoints on irrespective of the security policy. This is useful to avoid accidentally cutting off a host with incorrect configuration. For back-compatibility, if the protocol is not specified, it defaults to "tcp". If a CIDR is not specified, it will allow traffic from all addresses. To disable all inbound host ports, use the value none. The default value allows ssh access and DHCP. [Default: tcp:22, udp:68, tcp:179, tcp:2379, tcp:2380, tcp:6443, tcp:6666, tcp:6667]

If you want to exclude multiple interface names using a single value, the list supports regular expressions. For regular expressions you must wrap the value with '/'. For example having values '/^kube/,veth1' will exclude all interfaces that begin with 'kube' and also the interface 'veth1'. [Default: kube-ipvs0]
    interfacePrefix : str, default is Undefined, optional
        InterfacePrefix is the interface name prefix that identifies workload endpoints and so distinguishes them from host endpoint interfaces. Note: in environments other than bare metal, the orchestrators configure this appropriately.

    iptablesLockTimeout : str, default is Undefined, optional
        IptablesLockTimeout is the time that Felix will wait for the iptables lock, or 0, to disable. To use this feature, Felix must share the iptables lock file with all other processes that also take the lock. When running Felix inside a container, this requires the /run directory of the host to be mounted into the calico/node or calico/felix container. [Default: 0s disabled]
    iptablesMangleAllowAction : str, default is Undefined, optional
        iptables mangle allow action
    iptablesMarkMask : int, default is Undefined, optional

        iptables n a t outgoing interface filter
    iptablesPostWriteCheckInterval : str, default is Undefined, optional
        IptablesPostWriteCheckInterval is the period after Felix has done a write to the dataplane that it schedules an extra read back in order to check the write was not clobbered by another process. This should only occur if another application on the system doesn't respect the iptables lock. [Default: 1s]
    iptablesRefreshInterval : str, default is Undefined, optional
        IptablesRefreshInterval is the period at which Felix re-checks the IP sets in the dataplane to ensure that no other process has accidentally broken Calico's rules. Set to 0 to disable IP sets refresh. Note: the default for this value is lower than the other refresh intervals as a workaround for a Linux kernel bug that was fixed in kernel version 4.11. If you are using v4.11 or greater you may want to set this to, a higher value to reduce Felix CPU usage. [Default: 10s]
    ipv6Support : bool, default is Undefined, optional
